The SD card should look like this:

sd:/BOOTCODE
sd:/BIN.ELF
sd:/doom1.wad

BOOTCODE should be the ELF loader from prebuilts.
BIN.ELF is a built version of DooM.
doom1.wad should be the shareware doom1.wad file which is not provided in this repo.

This binary launches timedemo demo3 and can be used for benchmarks.
